  heat: Float,
  links: {
    link1: {
      edge: chart2_pointer,

      binding: Float
    },

## Map (node in the scale-space cluster hierarchy)

## Atlas (total scale-space cluster hierarchy for a given point cloud data set)
Under Construction!

## Fuzzy predicate (expressions constructed out of fuzzy logical operators over logical atoms formed by scale-space clusters)
Under Construction!
